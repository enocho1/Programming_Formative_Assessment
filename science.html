			<h3 id="1">Introduction</h3>
			<p>Science has always been at the heart of computing. Computers have allowed science to reach new heights by vastly enhancing the power humans have to perform complex calculations at great speed. We can
			now simulate systems such as the human body, stars or ecosystems in a way that was unthinkable as little as 30 years ago, leading to exciting new discoveries.</p>
			
			<h3 id="2">Origins</h3>
			<p>The idea of computing goes back to devices such as the abacus as a tool to aid with calculation. However, the first electronic computers appeared in World War 2. Colossus was the world's first electronic 
			programmable computer, designed by Tommy Flowers in Bletchley Park near Buckingham, England, to break German coded messages. After this the development of computers took off. They went from being 
			gigantic machines filling entire rooms, to single boards of transistors and chips to devices we can hold in the palm of your hand, thousands or even millions of times more powerful than those from even just
			a few years ago.</p>
